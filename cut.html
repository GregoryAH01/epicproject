                    <p>Non-linear editing on a computer hasn’t really changed in years. While the interfaces may differ from system to system, the core concepts and workflows have remained the same. The cut page challenges the traditional way of working with innovative, yet familiar concepts such as source tape mode and an A/B trim tool. Two modern features that are rooted in the past. The cut page isn’t about simplification, it’s about removing the things you don’t need and building powerful, professional tools that help you work more quickly. And, sometimes, it means borrowing the things that were great about the past and bringing them <span class="nb-sm-up">into the future!</span></p>

            <div class="text-container">
                <p>Back in the days of tape, finding a clip was easy because you could just spool up and down the tape to see your media and select shots. Today, finding the right clip in a bin with hundreds of files is slow. With source tape, you no longer have to waste time hunting through bins to find the clip you need. Simply click on the source tape button and all of the clips in your bin appear in the viewer as a single long "tape". This makes it easy to scrub through all of your shots, find the parts you want, and quickly edit them to the timeline! It’s an old fashioned concept that’s completely modernized to help you find the shots <span class="nb-sm-up">you need fast!</span></p>

            <div class="text-container">
                <p>Zooming in and out and scrolling timelines is extremely slow! The new cut page features an innovative dual timeline so you never have to zoom in or out again. The upper timeline shows you the entire program while the lower timeline shows you the area in which you’re working. Both timelines are fully functional, allowing you to move and trim clips in whichever timeline is most convenient. Want to move a clip all the way to the end of your program? Simply pick it up from the lower timeline and drag it to the end of the upper timeline to move it down the edit. With the dual timeline, you’ll always know where you are because you always have a zoomed in timeline that’s ideal for trimming and fine tuning your edits using the contextual tools.</p>

                <p>Oftentimes, the only place you can perform accurate trimming is in the timeline. However with the new cut page, you can view trim points displayed in the viewer and trim extremely accurately. Also known as an A/B trimmer, this new graphical view lets you adjust each side of the edit with numeric frame counters and nudge tools. The new dedicated trim tool becomes active any time you trim a clip and allows precise trimming of clips before adding them into the timeline. Plus, when trimming in the timeline you can trim in 3 locations – the lower timeline, the upper timeline and the trim editor!</p>

            <div class="text-container">
                <p>Reviewing footage that you didn’t shoot yourself can delay the start of an edit session. It’s vital to become familiar with your media before you can start editing. Fast review speeds up this process by fast playing through your clips and intelligently adjusting playback speed depending on the length of the clip. Fast review works with the source tape, or even the timeline, and lets you quickly review media without playing back any single clip too fast, so you don't inadvertently miss a shot. Short clips <span class="nb-md-up">will playback</span> slower than longer clips, however long clips are limited in speed so they don't play too fast. You also get tape style audio scrubbing with automatic pitch correction which makes it easier to understand the audio at higher speeds!</p>
